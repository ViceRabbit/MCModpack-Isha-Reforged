Minecraft: Isha Reforged is an apparent committed modpack designated for the use of friends; currently being worked by Netherite_Wails13 and ViceRabbit!

## Expected Release Date: # 1st of July-ish

As of the content within this particular modpack, it mostly relies upon performance but balances the modded content; and this is different than other popular modpacks due to them costing huge frame drops for low-end devices - which this modpack is particularly designed for! (And also not to mention, we have very shitty laptops). 
The release date will be around the month of June; this is to give us, Vice and Wails time to beta test this modpack and ensure performance is to its perfect limits. This is also the perfect month due to us having summer break from school and my graduation occuring; giving us to spend time.
